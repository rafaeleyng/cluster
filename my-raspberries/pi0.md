# review

from https://www.androidauthority.com/raspberry-pi-zero-w-review-756498/:

It is a fully working 32-bit computer with a 1 GHz ARMv6 single core microprocessor (ARM1176), a VideoCore 4 GPU, and 512 MB of memory. The GPU is capable of driving a full HD display at 60 fps

The Zero W uses the Cypress CYW43438 wireless chip as Raspberry Pi 3 Model B meaning it has 802.11n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity
